                After meeting in Oakland in the spring of 2012, We Vote co-founders Dale McGrew and Jenifer Fernandez Ancona became fast friends.
                {' '}

                {' '}
                and Jenifer brings political, advocacy and fundraising experience from years on the front-lines of national campaigns.
                {' '}
                Through frequent conversations, the idea of a nonprofit “Yelp for Politics” was born.
                {' '}
                Founded in 2014, We Vote would be a community for voters, they decided, created by people concerned about where this country is heading.
                {' '}
                Being an open source, volunteer-driven project means anyone can contribute. Kind of like democracy.
